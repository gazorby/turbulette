To help you modularize your API, Turbulette allows you to split your project into reusable *applications*, very similar to what Django does.

## Project

Basically, a Turbulette project is a composition of applications, each one having its own GraphQL schema, resolvers, database models etc. Like in Django, they can be "toggled" using the `INSTALLED_APPS` settings:

=== ".env"

    ``` bash
    INSTALLED_APPS=myproject.app_1,myproject.app_2
    ```

=== "settings.py"

    ``` python
    from starlette.datastructures import CommaSeparatedStrings

    ...

    INSTALLED_APPS = config("INSTALLED_APPS", cast=CommaSeparatedStrings, default=[])
    ```

To create a project, use the built-in *turb* CLI:

``` bash
turb project --name eshop
```

You should get with something like this :

```console
.
└── 📁 eshop
    ├── 📁 alembic
    │   ├── 📄 env.py
    │   └── 📄 script.py.mako
    ├── 📄 .env
    ├── 📄 alembic.ini
    ├── 📄 app.py
    └── 📄 settings.py
```

Let's break down the structure :

- `📁 eshop`

    Here is the so-called *Turbulette project* folder, it will contain applications and project-level configuration files

- `📁 alembic`

    Contains the [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) scripts used when generating/applying DB migrations:

    - `📄 env.py`

        This module is the entrypoint used by Alembic to manage database migrations. In most cases, you don't need to edit this file, you just want it to stay in the alembic folder.

    - `📄 script.py.mako`

        The template used by alembic to generate migrations. I you open it, you will see the Python code that generates a migration. When Alembic creates it, it will just replace tags with actual values.

- `📄 .env`

    The actual project settings live here

- `📄 app.py`

    Your API entrypoint, it defines the ASGI app where the server must point.

- `📄 settings.py`

    The project settings module, see [settings](/user_guide/settings)

!!! question
    Why have both `.env` and `settings.py`?

    You don't *have to*. You can also put all your settings in `settings.py`.
    But Turbulette encourage you to follow the [twelve-factor methodology](https://12factor.net),
    that recommend to separate settings from code because config varies substantially across deploys, *code does not*.
    This way, you can untrack `.env` from version control and only keep tracking `settings.py`, which will load settings
    from `.env` using Starlette's `Config` object.

At this stage your API is not functional. To start coding, you need to create an application.

## Application

Run this command under the project directory (`eshop`) :

```bash
turb app -n account
```

!!! info
    You need to run `turb app` under the project directory because the CLI needs to access the `almebic.ini` file to create the initial database migration.

You should see your new application under the project folder :

```console
.
└── 📁 eshop
    ...
    |
    └── 📁 account
        ├── 📁 graphql
        ├── 📁 migrations
        │   └── 📄 20200926_1508_auto_ef7704f9741f_initial.py
        ├── 📁 resolvers
        └── 📄 models.py
```

Details :

- `📁 graphql`

    All the GraphQL schema exposed by the `account` application will live here.

    Only GraphQL files should be placed here, to clearly separate logic from the schema. By grouping your schema in a dedicated folder, you get an instant view of a specific part of your API's functionalities that is even understandable by non-technical folks.

- `📁 migrations`

    Contains database migrations generated by Alembic (or manually).

- `📁 resolvers`

    Python package where you will write GraphQL resolvers.

    On server startup, Turbulette will import GraphQL schema and resolvers defined by all installed applications and will ask Ariadne to *bind* resolvers to the schema. Ariadne uses decorators to bind resolvers functions, and because of how decorators works, Turbulette needs to import all resolvers it will find, that is, *everything* in the `resolver` package.

    Of course, you may have other packages holding your business logic, but it's strongly advised to ***not*** put them under the `resolver` package to not bloat imports at startup.

- `📄 models.py`

    Holds GINO models for this application. Turbulette won't look in other modules (unless they are imported in `models`), so you need all your models to be accessible here.
