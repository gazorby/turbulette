## Pytest plugin

Turbulette has a built-in pytest plugin to help you write unit tests for your API.

To use it, you'll need both
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and [pytest-asyncio](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio)

The Turbulette pytest plugin provides several fixtures to create the test database
and setup the ASGI app.
